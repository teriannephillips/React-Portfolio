        <p>
          I'm Terianne Phillips, a Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for
          technology and a diverse background. I have always been a quick
          learner and pay strong attention to detail, which has helped me excel
          in my work.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of technical skills, I am proficient in HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, Node.js, SQL, MongoDB, and React. I am also familiar with
          applications such as Slack, Git Bash, GitHub, Insomnia, and Heroku.

          I have worked on some exciting projects, including Feastful Finds, a
          recipe website that allows users to search for recipes by ingredients.
          I was responsible for developing most of the JavaScript functionality,
          including API calls, data extraction, and rendering on the HTML pages.
          I also worked on Vintage Cruisers, an e-commerce backend project for a
          vintage car rental website. My contributions included creating
          database models, implementing controllers, handling login/logout
          functionality, and developing rent handlebars using Node.js, Express,
          Handlebars, MySQL, and Sequelize.

          I have almost completed a Boot Camp Certificate program at Carleton University,
          focusing on gaining technical programming skills in various
          technologies. Prior to that, I pursued a Computer Systems Technician
          program at Algonquin College, where I gained expertise in software and
          hardware technical support. I also hold an Ontario Secondary School
          Diploma from Arnprior District High School.

          In my spare time, I enjoy expanding my knowledge in the field of web
          development, exploring new technologies, and contributing to
          open-source projects. I'm passionate about creating innovative
          solutions and constantly enhancing my skills as a developer.
